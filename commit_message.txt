feat: add Experimental Layout 1 with multi-row ring carousel and refine landing page

- Added `experimental-layout-1.html` featuring a multi-row heterogeneous carousel system:
  - Stacked rows with heights of 60px, 120px, 240px, and 480px.
  - Implemented infinite "ring" looping logic using DOM element recycling.
  - Unified input handling with Pointer Events (Mouse, Touch, Pen).
  - Synchronized rendering with `requestAnimationFrame` and high-frequency input debouncing.
  - Items are labeled with persistent `(Row, Index)` coordinates.
- Added design documentation in `experimental-layout-1.md`.
- Refined main landing page (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`):
  - Expanded quick launch bar to a 2-column grid with 10 icons.
  - Added two new mail-related SVG icons to the quick launch bar.
  - Renamed "Contact" section to "Misc" in navigation, content, and SPA routing.
